       <h1>ABOUT PERRY-TERRY'S SPORT ACADEMY</h1>
       <p>About Us
We use football to engage and inspire young people to build a better life for themselves and unite the communities in which they live.<br/>
Dedicated staff deliver educational and community outreach programmes to help young people make positive choices in their lives.</p>
<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p>Future Stars Academy believes in the power of sports. We are a non-profit organisation focusing on children, youth and sports (mainly football) 
with the aim to empower them and enhance their physical and mental health.<br/>

The Future Stars Academy is operating in Arusha and Moshi, Tanzania. We provide football training and competition (including attending tournaments) giving disadvantaged children from 6 to 20 years.<br/> Furthermore, we actively engage with local communities and support community development through various types of sports activities

We want all children and youth to have fun and hope, <br />and at the same time build their physical and mental resilience to cope with life. FSA offer them a chance to develop in soccer and give them access to education and future employment.</p>

<h4><mark>The academy has one rule: No school – No Play.</mark></h4>
<br /><br />

<h3>OUR PURPOSE</h3>
<p>Future Stars Academy wants to pursue sustainable social development for the youth by working on leadership, empowerment and sense of responsibility within the kids.<br />
 We call it social development through sports. It is not ‘just’ about playing football, but about using football (and sports) as a tool to touch base on other crucial issues for the youth in Arusha and Moshi and help them in <br />
 becoming responsible members for their local communities.</p>
<br /><br />

<h3>OUR SUPPORTERS</h3>
<p>We have received worldwide recognition and support from donors and sponsors for our work in the community. Our club have some loyal supporters and we are very grateful for their support.
<br />
It’s not only about giving; partnering up with us means that you as an organization, donor or grant have a great impact on the community and life of children. But also a huge reach on other partners, <br />
companies and people through our events and activities.</p>
